# Machine_learning,
this is a hackathon named winter of code where I have created 3 algorithms from scratch using three libraries namely numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.
All 3 algorithms are saved in 3 different files namely Linear Regression ( multi-variate)-best version.ipynb, Polynomial Regression -Copy1-checkpoint.ipynb and logistic_regression mine.ipynb. You can view the data set I used for Linear regression in linear_test.csv, and trained it against linear_train.csv. You can view the data set I used for Polynomial regression in polynomial_test.csv, and trained it against polynomial_train.csv. You can view the data set I used for Logistic regression in classification_test.csv. For further information you can read the meraj woc[1}.docx file.
