# Machine_learning,
this is a hackathon named winter of code where I have created 5 algorithms from scratch using three libraries namely numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.
All 5 algorithms are saved in 5 different files namely nKNN best-checkpoint.ipynb,Linear Regression ( multi-variate)-best version.ipynb,N-layered neural network(2).ipynb,Polynomial Regression -Copy1-checkpoint.ipynb and logistic_regression mine.ipynb
