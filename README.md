# Machine_learning,
this is a hackathon named winter of code where I have created 3 algorithms from scratch using three libraries namely numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.
All 3 algorithms are saved in 3 different files namely Linear Regression ( multi-variate)-best version.ipynb, Polynomial Regression -Copy1-checkpoint.ipynb and logistic_regression mine.ipynb. You can view the data set I used for Linear regression in linear_test.csv, and trained it against linear_train.csv. You can view the data set I used for Polynomial regression in polynomial_test.csv, and trained it against polynomial_train.csv. You can view the data set I used for Logistic regression in classification_test.csv. I have calculated the accuracy of each. R2 accuracy for Linear Regression is 84.28. R2 accuracy for Polynomial Regression is 99.99 .R2 accuracy for Logistic Regression is 80.46.For further information you can read the meraj woc[1}.docx file.
