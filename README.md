# Machine_learning,
this is a hackathon named winter of code where i have created 5 algorithms from scratch using three libraries m=namelyt numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot
all 5 algorithms are saved in 5 different files namely nKNN best-checkpoint.ipynb,Linear Regression ( multi-variate)-best version.ipynb,N-layered neural network.ipynb,Polynomial Regression -Copy1-checkpoint.ipynb and logistic_regression-final_submission_file.ipynb
